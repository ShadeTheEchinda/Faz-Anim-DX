Faz-Anim is a Five Nights at Freddy's Fangame using the RR-Engine for simulation.

# Description
The RR Engine is a Unity codebase for simulating and animating old animatronics, with various features to customize the viewing experience.

The software is split into two major sections. The Editor Mode allows users to meticulously look at and edit animation files
while giving a variety of analysis options. The Game Mode provides a first-person view of the animatronic stages, 
allowing the user more customizability in the presentation, while also giving simplified controls. The Game Mode also
has features to unlock special items as rewards for animating the simulated animatronics. This is usually stage props
or movable animatronics, allowing the player to create a fully custom stage or layout to host their animations.
